/**
 * <p>
 * An image with a set of operations applied to it.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The EditableImage represents an image with a series of operations applied to it.
 * It is fairly core to the ANDIE program, being the central data structure.
 * The operations are applied to a copy of the original image so that they can be undone.
 * THis is what is meant by "A Non-Destructive Image Editor" - you can always undo back to the original image.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Internally the EditableImage has two {@link BufferedImage}s - the original image 
 * and the result of applying the current set of operations to it. 
 * The operations themselves are stored on a {@link Stack}, with a second {@link Stack} 
 * being used to allow undone operations to be redone.
